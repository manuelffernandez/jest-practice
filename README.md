## Installation

For this project I used v18.14.2 of NodeJS. There is a *.nvmrc* file to select the correct version with **nvm**. If you don't have it, ensure that you have installed that specific node version.

<sub>See [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) for more info.</sub>

To get started clone the repository and run:

-  `npm i` or `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
-  `npm run dev` to launch the application in your browser.
